         value of the environment variable JHBUILD_PREFIX. You can

         throughout this file on the form "${prefix:name}". This is
         useful for installing certain libraries or even the
         application itself separately. Note that JHBUILD_PREFIX is
         defined by jhbuild, so it you are not using jhbuild you can
         either define your own or just hardcode the path here.

  <!-- Icon themes to copy. The "icons" property can be either of

       self-explanatory, while auto means that the script will try to
       figure out which icons are needed. This is done by getting all
       the strings from all copied binaries, and matching them against
       icon names. To be safe, you should use "all". "none" is useful
       if you want just the index.theme file but no icons, mostly
       needed for the "hicolor" base theme.
