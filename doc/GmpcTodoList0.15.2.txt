Gmpc
-----

6. Skip to next album keybinding.
7. Rethink keybindings, is a mess now.
8. Try to finish help/manual.

Gmpc 0.15.5+
------------
1. Show tooltips in GmpcMpdDataTreeview (Gtk 2.12 api)
    a. Model tooltip after the notification tooltip (image on left, + some basic song info)
2. Move main playlist to use the GmpcMpdDataModel, do this by inheriting GmpcMpdDataModel and writing custom filling functions.
    a. This will remove any remaining support for mpd 0.11.*
    b. Can resue GmpcMpdDataTreeview 
    c. Easier for extreplaylist to provide more full interface.
    d. implicitely supports 1
3.  Plugins connection_changed and status change removed? (use GmpcConnection) (no sure yet).
4.  Turn the browser list into a list.
    a. Write 2 Models, one that shows all. one that showed filtered list.
5.  Create a button list that can use GtkTreeModel backend. As possible alternative of the dropdown in collapsed mode.
6.  Support loading an image directly from the internet. (This can be prefered when using a metadata daemon).
7.  Make a non-blocking signal based curl download module. (Keep old api for plugins where blocking does not matter (allready runs in other thread)).
    This is usefull for f.e. 6. and magnatune/jamendo plugin.



Plugins
-------
1. Allow for user-space installation from configure script.
