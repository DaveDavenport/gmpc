If you haven't used anyother client with mpd yet, you won't see any music in the playlist. 
You need to add music from mpd's database to the playlist. In gmpc you can do this in different ways, for example using the File brohttp://qballcow.nl/Guide/Manual.htmlwser.

.The File Browser

The file browser acts like any other file browser. You can browse through the music in the way it's stored on the filesystem.

[NOTE]
If you don't see any folders of music here, it's possible mpd's database haven't been updated yet. You can do this by right-clicking on the "Browse Filesystem" and select update. If this doesn't work (it might take some time), please look at mpd's link:http://mpd.wikia.com[Wiki]

To add a folder, or music-file right click and select add (or press insert-key to add the selected items).
You will see a message in the status bar.

Advanced features
-----------------

Gmpc can be further configured by directy edited the config file. If you edit the configuration file directly make sure gmpc isn't running.
There configuration file is stored in '~/.gmpc/' and is called 'gmpc.cfg'.

The following extra changes can be made:

1. *playlist::background-load-playlist*: Gmpc's playlist works using a lazy loading model.  It only loads the song info of the visible songs, this increases startup speed, and saves alot of (startup) bandwidth. But it does make searching the playlist slow the first time.  With this option gmpc starts filling in the missing data of the playlist in the background. (This can slow gmpc down when connected to mpd using a very slow connection) 
2. *playlist::player_markup*: This allows you to change the way gmpc displays the song information in the player part of the window. Editing this markup you should keep in mind that the processed result is a valid pango markup. (see pango documentation).
3. *Default::allow-multiple*: Gmpc normally only allows one instant per user to be running, with this option you can turn that extra check off.  (This option only works when gmpc is compiled with session support).
4. *connection::mpd-update-speed*: Change the speed gmpc poll's mpd for status/state changes. The value denotes the time between checks in ms. 
5. *connection::profile-file*: Gmpc stores the created profiles in a seperate config file, with this option you can change the location of this file.
6. *tray-icon::y/x-offset*: Change the x/y offset the tooltip makes relative to the corner it's placed at.
7. *tray-icon::middle-mouse-action*: Change the behauviour middle mouse clicking on the tray icon. Valid values are: pause,play,next,prev,stop 
8. *cover-art::browser-size*: Change the size of cover images in the browsers. At the moment this has only effect on the artist browser.
