== The main interface

The following image displays GMPC's main window:

image:Images/main-window.png[]

If you collapse the main window, parts of the window might be hidden. 
Currently there are 2 collapsed views.

Collapsed view 1:

=== Playback Controls
image:Images/playback-control.png[]


I will explain the elements from left to right.

==== Album Cover
image:Images/pc-cover.png[]

This shows cover of the currently playing album. If no cover is available, or the song has not information about it, an empty case or cd is shown.

[TIP]
=================================
* Hovering the cover will show an enlarged version of the cover.
* Right mouse click on the cover allows you to modify it.
* You can modify the look of the cover art in the preferences pane. (With or withouth the casing)


image:Images/pc-cover.png["With casing"]
image:Images/pc-cover-plain.png["Withouth casing"]

=================================

==== Song information
image:Images/pc-song-info.png[]

Next to it is basic information about the song. This shows the Title, artist and album name.

TIP: If you click on the title, artist or album name it will jump to that item in the Metadata Browser.


==== Favorite 
image:Images/pc-favorite-nhl.png[]

The heart-shaped icon allows you to mark (or unmark) the song as favorite by clicking in on it.

If the song is marked as favorite the icon is highlighted, if it is not a favorite, the icon is dimmed.

* image:Images/pc-favorite-hl.png["Song is a favorite"]
Marked as favorite:
* image:Images/pc-favorite-nhl.png["Sog is not a favorite"]
Not marked as favorite:


Favorite songs are stored in a playlist called Favorite.


TIP: Right click on the favorite icon allows you to add the current song to any playlist.

WARNING: To make favorites work, MPD needs to be able to store and load playlists.



==== Playback Control
image:Images/pc-playback-control.png[]

Of course the playback control buttons are also available: Play/Pause, Previous, Next, Stop and volume control.


[CAUTION]
=====================================================================
* You need sufficient permission to control playback. If you do not have the permission, the buttons will be made insensitive.
* If there is no output mixer defined in MPD, or it is not currently available, the Volume control is made insensitive.
=====================================================================

TIP: Hovering your mouse over the next button will show a tooltip with the title of the next song.

==== Seek bar
image:Images/pc-seek-bar.png[]

Below is the progress/seek bar. This indicates how much of the song is allready played. 
You can drag the bar to a certain position to seek. Pressing the middle mouse button will instantly jump to that position. 

On the right of the seekbar is the progressed time (or remaining, see tip) and the total time of the song (if available).


[TIP]
=======================
* Right mouse click on the seekbar changes the time indication from progressed time to remaining time and back.
* Hovering the progress bar  will show you the time (or remaining) under the cursor. Allowing you to seek exactly to one point.
=======================

NOTE: Seeking is not instant, but the seek is done as you drop the handle. This is done so MPD is not spammed with seek requests.

=== Message bar
image:Images/message-bar.png[]

The message bar is only visible when GMPC has to tell you something. The messsage bar can show information, warning and errors. 

A list of previous shown (or hidden) messages can be seen in the Show messages window under Help->show messages.

TIP: You can set what message should be shown in the message bar in the xref:preferences[preferences].

[[sidebar]]
=== Sidebar
image:Images/sidebar.png[]

The sidebar allows you to switch between different browsers. 
You can reorder the browsers by drag and dropping them to there new place in the list.
What browsers are visible depend on the plugins installed and settings.

If you collapse the view the sidebar is turned into a horizontal selector:

image:Images/sidebar-hori1.png[]

Or if configured differently in the xref:preferences[preferences], a list of buttons:

image:Images/sidebar-hori2.png[]


TIP: The top browser is always selected when you connect to an MPD server.

NOTE: When collapsing the view, the sidebar is turned into a horizontal view, below the playback controls and when collapsed further the sidebar is hidden.

=== Browser window

The browser window contains the actual browser, how this looks depends on the selected view. Browsers should (normally) follow the same generic layout.
Either one large pane (like now playing, search, play-queue, etc). Or 2 panes (like database, metadata browser, etc), where the size of the panes is synced between the browsers. 

One pane view:

image:Images/browser-pane-single.png[]

Two pane view:

image:Images/browser-pane-double.png[]

NOTE: When the view is completely collapsed the Browser window is hidden.

=== Statusbar
image:Images/status-bar.png[]

At the bottom of the screen is the status bar. The statusbar is hidden when gmpc is fully collapsed.

The status bar consists of 2 parts:

On the left there is a message block. This shows feedback about changes, like 'repeat enabled', '10 songs added to play-queue'. It indicates if some action was succesful.

On the right there are status icons. 

==== Status icons
image:Images/status-icons.png[]

Status icons are small icons indicating the state of a setting, a plugin or shows that something is in progress. 

Currently GMPC always shows the following status icons:

* Repeat
* Random
* Single mode
* Consume 

Some icons only show when f.e. MPD is updating it database.
All status icons should have a tooltip.

NOTE: Clicking a status icon may change its state.

NOTE: Some status icons, like from the gmpc-shout plugin, can have a context menu.

[[preferences]]
== Preferences

=== Connection
image:Images/preferences-connection.png[]

In the connection pane you can configure the connection to MPD.
You can define multiple connection profiles. GMPC allows you to quickly switch between the different profiles.

* The 'Name' field holds the name GMPC shows for this connection.
* The 'Host' field holds the hostname off the MPD machine. It may also holds the path to a socket.
* The 'Port' field holds the port where MPD listens on. 
* 'Use authentication' tells GMPC to send the 'Password' field on connection. You need this, if you want an authentication with your MPD Server.

=== Metadata Handler
image:Images/preferences-metadata-handler.png[]

The metadata handler is a function in GMPC to give priority to different plugins.
You can give every plugin a number between 1 and 100 where 1 is the lowest and 100 the highest priority.
GMPC will use these numbers to share the amount of resources between every plugin, this means the higher priority a plugin has, the more resources it gets allocated.

=== Proxy
image:Images/preferences-proxy.png[]

=== Metadata Browser
image:Images/preferences-metadata-browser.png[]

== Metadata Selector
You can open the metadata selector by right clicking on the metadata item, f.e. a lyrics and selecting 'metadata selector'.
image:Images/meta-data-selector-artist.png[]
image:Images/meta-data-selector-lyrics.png[]

If gmpc fails to find the right metadata, you can view all the results in the metadata selector.  You can edit the exact value of the query fields and retry the query.
As you can see in the above screenshots you can see the results, where they came from and the size (if it is an image)

The following items can be selected:

* Artist art
* Album cover
* Song lyric
* Album Information
* Artist Biography
* Guitar tab.

== Browsers

=== Now Playing
image:Images/nowplaying.png[]

The now playing browser shows you all sorts of information about the song playing right now.
Information found on the now playing page changes as soon as a new track starts. 

* 'Album picture': The image in the upper left corner is the album picture.

To the right of the tabbed view there is a list of other albums from the currently playing artist.
When you click on one of the albums, it will give you information about the album in the metadata browser.

NOTE: The album list will only be shown when there are actually other albums from the artist in your mpd database.

=== Database

image:Images/database.png[]

The database browser is a directory listing of all your music. With the browser you can browse through all your music currently in the mpd database.
The folder tree looks like a real folder tree, but it actually is a copy of the music folder tree.
In case you delete, add or change files, you must first update the database to update the folder/file tree.
As you can see on the screenshot there are two parts of the window.
To the left you can see the folder tree, this shows all folders in your music folder.
Next to the folder tree are colums which show the files and folders from the currently selected folder (the one selected in the folder tree).

When you right click on a folder in the folder tree, you get three options.

* 'Add': Adds all music files in the selected folder to the playlist.
* 'Replace': Empties the current playlist and adds all music files in the selected folder to the playlist.
* 'Update': Updates the database (and the folder tree).

You can also right click on a folder or file in the right window. The following options are available.

* 'Add': Adds the specific file(s) and/or folder(s) to the playlist.
* 'Replace': Empties the current playlist and adds the specific file(s) and/or folder(s) to the playlist.
* 'Update': Updates the database and the left folder tree. (Only available when right clicking a folder)
* 'Information': Shows information about the selected song. (Only available when right clicking one song)
* 'Add to playlist': Gives a number of options to add the selected file or folder to a playlist. (Only works for one file or folder at a time)
** 'New': Gives you the possibility to create a new playlist.
** List of playlists: all available playlists are shown here.
* 'Add more': Gives a number of options to add more files to the playlist. (Only showing up when right clicking one song)
** 'All from album': Adds all songs from the same album to the playlist.
** 'All from artist': Adds all songs from the same artist to the playlist.
** 'All from genre': Adds all songs from the same genre to the playlist.
** 'All from same directory': Adds all songs from the same directory to the playlist.
* 'Tools': Gives a number of options for the selected folder(s) and/or file(s).
** 'Metadata selector': Gives you the possibility to find information about the selected song. (Album cover, artist art, lyrics etc.)
** 'Queue songs for tag edit': Tag Edit gives you the possibility to modify ID3 tags. (Only works with the Tag Edit plugin enabled)
* 'Copy': Copies the selected folder(s) and/or file(s), you can paste them in the playlist.
* 'Edit columns': With this function you can enable/disable columns from showing in the right window. (Check the image for available options)

image:Images/database-columns.png[]

=== Play Queue
image:Images/play-queue.png[]


This is basically your master-playlist. Every title you want to listen to will appear here. You can add songs to the play-queue by opening the context menu (right mouse click) in either the file in the database or the playlist-editor and selecting "Add". 

==== Sorting
You can move a single song to a new location using drag and drop. You can move a single row by selecting it, and dragging it to the new location.
To quickly move around multiple songs you can cut, copy and then paste songs within the play-queue. It is even possible to copy songs from other lists and insert them at a certain position in the play-queue.

NOTE: GTK does not yet provide a method of moving multiple rows using drag and drop. Instead of adding this using dirty hacks, a more robust cut/copy/paste system was added.

==== Filter
You can filter the play-queue by pressing 'ctrl-f' or start typing when it is selecting. The playlist filter supports the xref:query-syntax[Query syntax]. 

TIP: If the filter is slow in updating the playlist, because you are on a slow connection or MPD runs on a slow machine. You can disable search-as-you-type in the xref:preferences[preferences] pane.


==== Editing columns
You can edit what columns GMPC displays in the play-queue (or any song list), by opening the xref:play-queue-context-menu[context-menu] (right click) and selecting 'edit columns'

[[play-queue-context-menu]]
==== Context menu
If you do a right click on an entry of the play queue, you will get this context-menu:

image:Images/play-queue-rightclick.png[]


NOTE: This context-menu will depend on the plugins you have installed and activated. Some plugins cause an entry here, others don't.


==== Useful key-bindings

* 'Center playing song': Hit the space bar.
* 'Delete selected song':  Hit del.
* 'Opening filter': Ctrl-f.
* 'Empty filter': Escape.
* 'Close filter':  Escape or backspace when empty.

TIP: If you enable 'Enable songlist tooltip' in xref:preferences[preferences] pane. Gmpc will show a tooltip with the album cover and some information about the song you are hovering.




=== Tag Browser

=== Search

=== Metadata Browser

== Server Information
image:Images/server-information.png[]

[[query-syntax]]
== Query Syntax

The query syntax is used in the search browser, the playlist quick search and in easy command.

The syntax consists of the following:

---------------
<field>=<value>
---------------

This will search for value in the field field.

The following fields are supported:

    artist
    album
    title
    track
    Name (applies to streams)
    Genre
    Date
    Composer
    Performer
    Comment
    Disc
    Filename
    AlbumArtist
    Any (searches all the above fields) 

If your MPD does not support any of these fields, they will be ignored and seen as part of the command.

The search is tokenized and case insensitive, so for example:

-------------------
artist=eric clapton
-------------------

Will match both "eric clapton", "Clapton, Eric". To stop this tokenization wrap the values in (). For example:

---------------------
artist=(Eric Clapton)
---------------------

Will not match "Clapton, Eric".


To refine your search multiple queries can be concatenated:

For example:

----------------------------------
artist=Eric Clapton album=Slowhand
----------------------------------

There is also an option to run multiple queries at once by using the or operator ||:

-----------------------------------------
artist=Eric Clapton || artist=Norah Jones
-----------------------------------------

This will return all songs by Eric Clapton and Norah Jones.

NOTE: If <field= > is ommited, all fields are searched. 


== Easy Command
image:Images/Gmpc-easy-command.png[]

GMPC has an feature called "Easy Command". Easy command gives you a small command box, allowing you to quickly execute commands without having to use the mouse.

For example, send the command to gmpc to search in the play queue for the song Holy Mother from the artist Eric Clapton and play that song immediately the following could easily be typed.

First, start the "easy command" mode:

----------
ctrl-space
----------

Next, type the following command:

------------------------------------------
play title=Holy mother artist=Eric Clapton
------------------------------------------

You can also concatenate commands:

--------------------------------------------
clear; add artist=Strehli; play title=SRV
--------------------------------------------

You can also bind a global one in preferences -> Multimedia Keys.

Some commands use the xref:query-syntax[Query syntax].
