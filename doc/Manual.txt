If you haven't used anyother client with mpd yet, you won't see any music in the playlist. 
You need to add music from MPD's database to the playlist. In gmpc you can do this in different ways, for example using the File brohttp://qballcow.nl/Guide/Manual.htmlwser.

.The File Browser

The file browser acts like any other file browser. You can browse through the music in the way it's stored on the filesystem.

[NOTE]
If you don't see any folders of music here, it's possible MPD's database haven't been updated yet. You can do this by right-clicking on the "Browse Filesystem" and select update. If this doesn't work (it might take some time), please look at MPD's link:http://mpd.wikia.com[Wiki]

To add a folder, or music-file right click and select add (or press insert-key to add the selected items).
You will see a message in the status bar.
