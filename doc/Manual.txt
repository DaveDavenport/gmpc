The following image displays GMPC's main window:

image:Images/main-window.png[]

If you collapse the main window, parts of the window might be hidden. 
Currently there are 2 collapsed views.

=== Playback Controls
image:Images/playback-control.png[]


I will explain the elements from left to right.

==== Album Cover
image:Images/pc-cover.png[]

This shows cover of the currently playing album. If no cover is available, or the song has not information about it, an empty case or cd is shown.

[TIP]
=================================
* Hovering the cover will show an enlarged version of the cover.
* Right mouse click on the cover allows you to modify it.
* You can modify the look of the cover art in the preferences pane. (With or withouth the casing)


image:Images/pc-cover.png["With casing"]
image:Images/pc-cover-plain.png["Withouth casing"]

=================================

==== Song information
image:Images/pc-song-info.png[]

Next to it is basic information about the song. This shows the Title, artist and album name.

TIP: If you click on the title, artist or album name it will jump to that item in the Metadata Browser.


==== Favorite 
image:Images/pc-favorite-nhl.png[]

The heart-shaped icon allows you to mark (or unmark) the song as favorite by clicking in on it.

If the song is marked as favorite the icon is highlighted, if it is not a favorite, the icon is dimmed.

* image:Images/pc-favorite-hl.png["Song is a favorite"]
Marked as favorite:
* image:Images/pc-favorite-nhl.png["Sog is not a favorite"]
Not marked as favorite:


Favorite songs are stored in a playlist called Favorite.


TIP: Right click on the favorite icon allows you to add the current song to any playlist.

WARNING: To make favorites work, MPD needs to be able to store and load playlists.



==== Playback Control
image:Images/pc-playback-control.png[]

Of course the playback control buttons are also available: Play/Pause, Previous, Next, Stop and volume control.


[CAUTION]
=====================================================================
* You need sufficient permission to control playback. If you do not have the permission, the buttons will be made insensitive.
* If there is no output mixer defined in MPD, or it is not currently available, the Volume control is made insensitive.
=====================================================================

TIP: Hovering your mouse over the next button will show a tooltip with the title of the next song.

==== Seek bar
image:Images/pc-seek-bar.png[]

Below is the progress/seek bar. This indicates how much of the song is allready played. 
You can drag the bar to a certain position to seek. Pressing the middle mouse button will instantly jump to that position. 

On the right of the seekbar is the progressed time (or remaining, see tip) and the total time of the song (if available).


[TIP]
=======================
* Right mouse click on the seekbar changes the time indication from progressed time to remaining time and back.
* Hovering the progress bar  will show you the time (or remaining) under the cursor. Allowing you to seek exactly to one point.
=======================

NOTE: Seeking is not instant, but the seek is done as you drop the handle. This is done so MPD is not spammed with seek requests.

=== Message bar
image:Images/message-bar.png[]

The message bar is only visible when GMPC has to tell you something. The messsage bar can show information, warning and errors. 

A list of previous shown (or hidden) messages can be seen in the Show messages window under Help->show messages.

TIP: You can set what message should be shown in the message bar in the xref:preferences[preferences].

[[sidebar]]
=== Sidebar
image:Images/sidebar.png[]

The sidebar allows you to switch between different browsers. 
You can reorder the browsers by drag and dropping them to there new place in the list.
What browsers are visible depend on the plugins installed and settings.

If you collapse the view the sidebar is turned into a horizontal selector:

image:Images/sidebar-hori1.png[]

Or if configured differently in the xref:preferences[preferences], a list of buttons:

image:Images/sidebar-hori2.png[]


TIP: The top browser is always selected when you connect to an MPD server.

NOTE: When collapsing the view, the sidebar is turned into a horizontal view, below the playback controls and when collapsed further the sidebar is hidden.

=== Browser window

The browser window contains the actual browser, how this looks depends on the selected view. Browsers should (normally) follow the same generic layout.
Either one large pane (like now playing, search, play-queue, etc). Or 2 panes (like database, metadata browser, etc), where the size of the panes is synced between the browsers. 

One pane view:

image:Images/browser-pane-single.png[]

Two pane view:

image:Images/browser-pane-double.png[]

NOTE: When the view is completely collapsed the Browser window is hidden.

=== Statusbar
image:Images/status-bar.png[]

At the bottom of the screen is the status bar. The statusbar is hidden when gmpc is fully collapsed.

The status bar consists of 2 parts:

On the left there is a message block. This shows feedback about changes, like 'repeat enabled', '10 songs added to play-queue'. It indicates if some action was succesful.

On the right there are status icons. 

==== Status icons
image:Images/status-icons.png[]

Status icons are small icons indicating the state of a setting, a plugin or shows that something is in progress. 

Currently GMPC always shows the following status icons:

* Repeat
* Random
* Single mode
* Consume 

Some icons only show when f.e. MPD is updating it database.
All status icons should have a tooltip.

NOTE: Clicking a status icon may change its state.

NOTE: Some status icons, like from the gmpc-shout plugin, can have a context menu.

[[preferences]]
== Preferences

=== Connection
image:Images/preferences-connection.png[]

In the connection pane you can configure the connection to MPD.
You can define multiple connection profiles. GMPC allows you to quickly switch between the different profiles.

* The 'Name' field holds the name GMPC shows for this connection.
* The 'Host' field holds the hostname off the MPD machine. It may also holds the path to a socket.
* The 'Port' field holds the port where MPD listens on. 
* 'Use authentication' tells GMPC to send the 'Password' field on connection. You need this, if you want an authentication with your MPD Server.
* The 'Music Directory' field allows you to tell GMPC where it can find the music.


=== Server Settings
image:Images/preferences-server-settings.png[]

When connected to MPD, you can configure several parameters in MPD:

* 'Enable Crossfade': Tells MPD to fade the song out and the fade in the new song in 'fade time(s)' seconds.
* 'Replaygain': Select the replaingain mode.
* 'Output devices': Enable/disable output devices.


=== Interface 
image:Images/preferences-interface.png[]

  image:Images/pc-cover.png["With casing"]
  image:Images/pc-cover-plain.png["Withouth casing"]
  
* 'Stop playing on exit':  If you quit GMPC, stop playback.
* 'Show song tooltip': Enabled tooltips on the song list. Showing an information about the song under the mouse pointer.

=== Tag Based Browser 
image:Images/preferences-tag-based-browser.png[]

=== Multimedia Keys
image:Images/preferences-multimedia-keys.png[]

=== Notification
image:Images/preferences-notification.png[]

=== Metadata Handler
image:Images/preferences-metadata-handler.png[]

=== Proxy
image:Images/preferences-proxy.png[]

=== Metadata Browser
image:Images/preferences-metadata-browser.png[]

== Metadata Selector
You can open the metadata selector by right clicking on the metadata item, f.e. a lyrics and selecting 'metadata selector'.
image:Images/meta-data-selector-artist.png[]
image:Images/meta-data-selector-lyrics.png[]

If gmpc fails to find the right metadata, you can view all the results in the metadata selector.  You can edit the exact value of the query fields and retry the query.
As you can see in the above screenshots you can see the results, where they came from and the size (if it is an image)

The following items can be selected:

* Artist art
* Album cover
* Song lyric
* Album Information
* Artist Biography
* Guitar tab.

== Browsers

=== Now Playing

=== Database

=== Play Queue
image:Images/play-queue.png[]


This is basically your master-playlist. Every title you want to listen to will appear here. You can add songs to the play-queue by opening the context menu (right mouse click) in either the file in the database or the playlist-editor and selecting "Add". 

==== Sorting
You can move a single song to a new location using drag and drop. You can move a single row by selecting it, and dragging it to the new location.
To quickly move around multiple songs you can cut, copy and then paste songs within the play-queue. It is even possible to copy songs from other lists and insert them at a certain position in the play-queue.

NOTE: GTK does not yet provide a method of moving multiple rows using drag and drop. Instead of adding this using dirty hacks, a more robust cut/copy/paste system was added.

==== Filter
You can filter the play-queue by pressing 'ctrl-f' or start typing when it is selecting. The playlist filter supports the xref:query-syntax[Query syntax]. 

TIP: If the filter is slow in updating the playlist, because you are on a slow connection or MPD runs on a slow machine. You can disable search-as-you-type in the xref:preferences[preferences] pane.


==== Editing columns
You can edit what columns GMPC displays in the play-queue (or any song list), by opening the xref:play-queue-context-menu[context-menu] (right click) and selecting 'edit columns'

[[play-queue-context-menu]]
==== Context menu
If you do a right click on an entry of the play queue, you will get this context-menu:

image:Images/play-queue-rightclick.png[]


NOTE: This context-menu will depend on the plugins you have installed and activated. Some plugins cause an entry here, others don't.


==== Useful key-bindings

* 'Center playing song': Hit the space bar.
* 'Delete selected song':  Hit del.
* 'Opening filter': Ctrl-f.
* 'Empty filter': Escape.
* 'Close filter':  Escape or backspace when empty.

TIP: If you enable 'Enable songlist tooltip' in xref:preferences[preferences] pane. Gmpc will show a tooltip with the album cover and some information about the song you are hovering.




=== Tag Browser

=== Search

=== Metadata Browser

== Server Information
image:Images/server-information.png[]

[[query-syntax]]
== Query Syntax

The query syntax is used in the search browser, the playlist quick search and in easy command.

The syntax consists of the following:

---------------
<field>=<value>
---------------

This will search for value in the field field.

The following fields are supported:

    artist
    album
    title
    track
    Name (applies to streams)
    Genre
    Date
    Composer
    Performer
    Comment
    Disc
    Filename
    AlbumArtist
    Any (searches all the above fields) 

If your MPD does not support any of these fields, they will be ignored and seen as part of the command.

The search is tokenized and case insensitive, so for example:

-------------------
artist=eric clapton
-------------------

Will match both "eric clapton", "Clapton, Eric". To stop this tokenization wrap the values in (). For example:

---------------------
artist=(Eric Clapton)
---------------------

Will not match "Clapton, Eric".


To refine your search multiple queries can be concatenated:

For example:

----------------------------------
artist=Eric Clapton album=Slowhand
----------------------------------

There is also an option to run multiple queries at once by using the or operator ||:

-----------------------------------------
artist=Eric Clapton || artist=Norah Jones
-----------------------------------------

This will return all songs by Eric Clapton and Norah Jones.

NOTE: If <field= > is ommited, all fields are searched. 


== Easy Command
image:Images/Gmpc-easy-command.png[]

GMPC has an feature called "Easy Command". Easy command gives you a small command box, allowing you to quickly execute commands without having to use the mouse.

For example, send the command to gmpc to search in the play queue for the song Holy Mother from the artist Eric Clapton and play that song immediately the following could easily be typed.

First, start the "easy command" mode:

----------
ctrl-space
----------

Next, type the following command:

------------------------------------------
play title=Holy mother artist=Eric Clapton
------------------------------------------

You can also concatenate commands:

--------------------------------------------
clear; add artist=Strehli; play title=SRV
--------------------------------------------

You can also bind a global one in preferences -> Multimedia Keys.

Some commands use the xref:query-syntax[Query syntax].
