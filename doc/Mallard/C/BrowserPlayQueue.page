    <title>Sorting</title>
    <p>You can move a single song to a new location using drag and drop. You can move a single row by selecting it, and dragging it to the new location. To quickly move around multiple songs you can cut, copy and then paste songs within the play-queue. It is even possible to copy songs from other lists and insert them at a certain position in the play-queue.</p>
    <note>
      <p>GTK does not yet provide a method of moving multiple rows using drag and drop. Instead of adding this using dirty hacks, a more robust cut/copy/paste system was added.</p>

    <title>Filter</title>
    <p>You can filter the play-queue by pressing 'ctrl-f' or start typing when it is selecting. The playlist filter supports the xref:query-syntax[Query syntax].</p>
    <note>
      <p>TIP: If the filter is slow in updating the playlist, because you are on a slow connection or MPD runs on a slow machine. You can disable search-as-you-type in the <link xref="PreferencesInterface">Preferences Interface</link> pane.</p>
