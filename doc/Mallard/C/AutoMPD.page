  <title>Auto MPD</title>
	<p>
		One of the hardest parts of getting GMPC to work is settings up MPD. 
		GMPC can now setup and run a MPD for you.

		<title>Requirments</title>
		<item>
			<title>Installed MPD.</title>
			<p>
				GMPC will look in the current $PATH for an MPD binary. 
			</p>
		</item>
	</terms>
	<p>
		If GMPC succesfully found a MPD binary it will add an 'AutoMPD' profile.
		Switching to this profile will start MPD in the background, switching away from this profile
		will stop MPD. By default MPD will be started with the following settings:

		<item>
			<title>Music Directory</title>
			<p>
				If it exists it tries to find the XDG specified music directory, otherwise it defaults to 
				<cmd>
					~/Music.
				</cmd>
			</p>
		</item>
		<item>
			<title>Audio Output</title>
			<p>
				By default an pulseaudio output is added. This should work on most desktops.
			</p>
		</item>
	</terms>
	<p>
		Some of these settings can be customized in the preferences pane.
		The music directory can be set in the connection pane (in the Auto MPD profile).
	</p>
	<note>
		<p>
			Once a setting has been changed, you must restart MPD using the <cmd>restart MPD</cmd> button.
		</p>
	</note>
	<p>
		Optional you can set alsa output and tell GMPC to keep the MPD running.
