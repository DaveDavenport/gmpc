        <title>Notification Area Icon</title>
        <p>The notification area icon gives you quick access to important features of GMPC, even if the main interface is hidden:</p>
        <list>
            <item><p>Change the volume through vertical mouse scrolling on the icon</p></item>
            <item><p>Choose the previous / next track through horizontal mouse scrolling on the icon</p></item>
        </list>

        <p>The notification area's menu offers the following options:</p>
        <list>
            <item><p>Show / hide the main interface</p></item>
            <item><p>Control playback (Play, Stop, Next track, Previous track)</p></item>
            <item><p>Quit GMPC</p></item>
        </list>
        
        <note><p>
            Ubuntu's new interface "Unity" uses a little different approach to provide notification area icons and GMPC will natively integrate into it if the support is compiled in. When you are not using Unity, you will automatically get a fallback icon. However, if you experience problems like missing icons in the context menu or if you can't change the volume by scrolling on the icon, you can switch back to the legacy tray icon through the respective option in the "Preferences"->"Interface"->"Advanced Settings" window.
