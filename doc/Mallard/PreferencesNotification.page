                The notification area icon gives you quick access to important features of GMPC, even if the main interface is hidden:
        
                <item>Change the volume through vertical mouse scrolling on the icon</item>
                <item>Choose the previous / next track through horizontal mouse scrolling on the icon</item>
            </item>
        </tree>

        <tree>
            <item>
                The notification area's menu offers the following options:
                
                <item>Show / hide the main interface</item>
                <item>Control playback (Play, Stop, Next track, Previous track)</item>
                <item>Quit GMPC</item>
            </item>
        </tree>
        
        <note><p>
            Ubuntu's new interface "Unity" uses a little different approach to provide tray icons and GMPC will natively integrate into it if the support is compiled in. When you are not on Unity, you will automatically get a fallback icon. However, if you experience problems like missing icons in the context menu or if you can't change the volume by scrolling on the icon, you can switch to the legacy tray icon by editing the "gmpc.cfg" file normally located under "~/.config/gmpc". The flag is named "use_appindicator" in the "tray-icon2" section.
