The changes for version 0.12 where:

* Better, more stable connection to mpd:
	I tried to implement this by extracting/abstracting all connectivity to mpd in libmpd.

* More user feedback:
	On error's a error window pop's up with a small error-msg.
	Better popup code, and a new popup markup.

* Faster:
	By removing the search function from the playlist window, and therefor not using gtk_tree_model_filter anymore the speed of the playlist is 4-5 faster. (even faster when the markup is limited to a single line).
	The Treeviews for the artist/file browser are a lazy tree. So only the absolute needed data is transfered from mpd.
	The songs are removed from the artist/file tree and displayed in a seperate pane.
	All these changes are implemented in a single window playlist design.
	Tested gmpc with up to 2^16 songs in the playlist, while still being responsive.

* Better support for streams: (implementation isn't overall perfect.)
	Implemented a custom stream browser, you can save streams client side.
	A browser for the xiph stream directory and possible others. (I will provide the top 1000 from shoutcast i.t.f.).
	!! As a note, this need some work to get all the bug's out. !!

* More flexibility.
	Custom song formatting.. (see above)
	Ability to disable/hide the stream browser/stream list.
	Enable/disable popup + popup location.
	Enable/disable tray icon. (optionall to hide the player on startup)
	player window scales with bigger font's so it fit.
	Tokenized search in playlist and mpd's data with regex support, allowing for very powerfull search expressions.

* MPD compatibility
	Offer options for the latest features in mpd.
	While staying backwards compatible with earlier version.

* Misc:
	Many more keybindings.
	Code is better readable/maintainable by abstracting different things out.
	Reducing the amount of duplicate code.
	Config file abstraction (in config.[c|h])
	New config file format (xml)
	Special care to find and fix memory leaks.

* Translation
	A new russian translation.
