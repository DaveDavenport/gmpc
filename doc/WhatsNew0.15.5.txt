After a very long way, it's finally there: **gmpc 0.15.5: while(bug_count > 0) fixBug(); **
So whats new and improved? to much to mention.
But I'll highlight some things.

New Features
------------
Some of these features may only work in combination with mpd from svn.

* Playlist queue's: You can now select songs to be played next. http://download.sarine.nl/gmpc-0.15.5/WhatsNew/playlist-queue.png[Screenshot]

* Chain search rules:   When searching in the playlist or the database you can now chain your queries using and and or f.e: **Artist "Norah Jones" and Album "Not Too Late" or Artist "Eric Clapton" and Album  "Unplugged"**. http://download.sarine.nl/gmpc-0.15.5/WhatsNew/search-browser.png[Screenshot]
* New Tag browser:  You can now create your own tag browsers in "itunes" style. With inline cover art. http://download.sarine.nl/gmpc-0.15.5/WhatsNew/tag-browser.png[Screenshot]
* Similar artist support:   The metadata can now show (if the last.fm plugin is installed) show similar artists, and allows you to browse them. http://download.sarine.nl/gmpc-0.15.5/WhatsNew/similar.png[Screenshot]
* Message bar:  When an event occurs, f.e. a disconnect gmpc now shows an inline message. The type of messages to be showed can be configured.
* Message window:   Shows a backlog of old messages showed in gmpc. http://download.sarine.nl/gmpc-0.15.5/WhatsNew/messages.png[Screenshot]

Improvements
------------
* File browser: The file browser now has 2 panes, one folder tree, and a folder content list. http://download.sarine.nl/gmpc-0.15.5/WhatsNew/file-browser.png[Screenshot]
* Sorting:      Song list, tag lists and more can everywhere be sorted by clicking on the headers.http://download.sarine.nl/gmpc-0.15.5/WhatsNew/sorting.png[Screenshot]
* Keybindings:  You can now easily with the keyboard enabled disable audio outputs, or switch from one browser to the other.
* Metadata:     It's now easier to (re)fetch metadata. 
* Drag and Drop: You can now drag and drop artist/albums from the metabrowser on the player-bar, adding to or replacing the current playlist.
* GtkStatusIcon: Tray icon now works on linux, windows and mac osX.
* Right mouse menu: This now works as expected, if you click on a selected row, it shows the menu, if you right click on a not-selected row, it will select the row first.
* Proxy:    The proxy can now be set from the preferences window.
* Reordering of the left pane.
* Huge amount of bugs fixed.
* An even huger amount of improvements in the code, allot of code re-use and duplication has been removed. 

Regressions and known Bugs
--------------------------
In every piece of software there are bugs, gmpc included.
These are luckily all low-impact bugs.

* Output state does not update correctly when set from another mpd client. This is partially a limitation of mpd.
* It's possible gmpc thinks it's connected to another profile then it actually is.
* The file browser when reconnected does not always show the right pane filled, selecting it again corrects it.
* Mouse over on the new tray-icon does not work, also scrolling does not. This is a limitation of gtk's GtkStatusIcon.
